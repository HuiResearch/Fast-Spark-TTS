## Introduction

> Powered by models like SparkTTS, OrpheusTTS, and MegaTTS3, this project provides high-quality Mandarin speech
> synthesis and voice cloning services. With an easy-to-use web interface, you can effortlessly generate natural,
> human-like voices for various use cases.

> If you find this project helpful, feel free to give it a star ⭐.

## ✨ Features

- 🚀 **Multiple backend accelerations**: Supports `vllm`, `sglang`, `llama cpp`, and `mlx-lm` for flexible inference
  strategies.
- 🎯 **High concurrency**: Dynamic batching greatly improves parallel processing capability.
- 🎛️ **Full parameter control**: Fully adjustable pitch, speed, timbre temperature, and more.
- 📱 **Lightweight deployment**: Minimal dependencies, fast startup based on Flask and FastAPI.
- 🎨 **Modern UI**: Clean and modern web interface.
- 🔊 **Long-form TTS**: Supports synthesis of very long texts while maintaining consistent voice quality.
- 🔄 **Streaming synthesis**: Real-time synthesis with immediate playback, reducing wait time and enhancing
  interactivity.
- 🎭 **Multi-role voice synthesis**: Enables synthesis of dialogue involving multiple characters.

## Inference Speed

- GPU: `A800`
- Model: `Spark-TTS-0.5B`
- Refer to [speed_test.py](examples/speed_test.py) for test parameters and methods.
- Audio length and inference time are measured in seconds.
- Evaluated on both short and long text scenarios.
- Official codes not benchmarked; feel free to run your own tests if needed.

| Scenario |  Engine   | Device | Audio Length | Cost Time |  RTF  |
|:--------:|:---------:|:------:|:------------:|:---------:|:-----:|
|  Short   | llama-cpp |  CPU   |     7.48     |   6.808   | 0.910 |
|  Short   |   torch   |  GPU   |     7.18     |   7.675   | 1.069 |
|  Short   |   vllm    |  GPU   |     7.24     |   1.664   | 0.230 |
|  Short   |  sglang   |  GPU   |     7.58     |   1.073   | 0.142 |
|   Long   | llama-cpp |  CPU   |    121.98    |  117.828  | 0.966 |
|   Long   |   torch   |  GPU   |    113.7     |  107.167  | 0.943 |
|   Long   |   vllm    |  GPU   |    111.82    |   7.282   | 0.065 |
|   Long   |  sglang   |  GPU   |    117.02    |   4.197   | 0.036 |

## Notes

1. The `SparkTTS` model does **not** support weight quantization to `float16`. Use `bfloat16` or `float32` for
   `torch_dtype`.
2. If there's a long silent segment in output, try adjusting `repetition_penalty` > 1.0 to reduce the chance of
   repeating silent tokens (silent token ID for SparkTTS is `163406`).
3. `OrpheusTTS` supports emotion tags. Just insert `<tag>` directly into the text. Refer to supported tags in
   `[orpheus_engine.py](fast_tts/engine/orpheus_engine.py)` via `LANG_MAP`.
4. For security reasons, the `MegaTTS3` team hasn't uploaded WaveVAE encoder parameters. Use the provided reference
   audios here for
   inference: [Reference Audio](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QhcHWcy20JfqWjgqZX1YM3I6i9u4oNlr). For custom
   audio, follow the official
   instructions: [MegaTTS3](https://github.com/bytedance/MegaTTS3/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#inference)
