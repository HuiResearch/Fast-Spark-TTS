## 🛠️ Getting Started

- [Installation Guide](get_started/installation.md): Learn how to install project dependencies, perform basic setup, and
  get started quickly.
- [Quick Start Guide](get_started/quick_start.md): A quick-start guide to using command-line tools to perform speech synthesis

## 🧠 Inference Engines and Models
